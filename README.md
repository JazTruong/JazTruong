# üëã Hey there!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Please check out my repo, where you'll find projects created during my 12-week Software Engineering Immersive program. These include a font-end, a full-stack CRUD website application, a full-stack Single Page Application utilising APIs, a React-based website application.

# üòÉ About Me :
I'm Jason, a Melbourne-based software engineer with a background in customer service and hospitality. Coding blew my mind with its limitless toolkit, where each line of code crafts a solution to a unique challenge. I'm captivated by its endless possibilities to solve problems, its iterative nature that fosters my quest for continuous learning, and my passion of transforming ideas into tangible, functional software or websites.

I thrive on thinking outside the box, pushing boundaries, and exploring unconventional approaches to problem-solving, whether it‚Äôs optimising front-end interfaces to create a seamless user experience or architecting back-end systems for scalable solutions. With an open mind primed for learning, a diligent work ethic, and a knack for logical thinking, I thrive on the creative process inherent in coding. From conceptualisation to execution, I thoroughly enjoy the journey of trial and error, constantly refining my skills and embracing new technologies. 

There's nothing quite like the rush of excitement and satisfaction that comes with cracking a tough problem or bringing a project to life. My journey in coding isn‚Äôt just about writing code ‚Äîit's a calling to make a meaningful impact through technology.

* üéì Graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program on 8th March 2024. 
* ü§© In my off-line time, I'm playing tennis üéæ, hiking with my doggies üê∂, or chilling out for a movie üçø
